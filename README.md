# 💸 Paisa App

> A radically fast, flow-based personal finance tracker.  
> Designed to **stay in the zone** — no clicks, no clutter, no friction.

---

## 🧠 Concept

**Paisa** reimagines how you enter personal finance data.  
Forget clunky forms and endless dropdowns.  
Inspired by **Vim**, **Typeform**, and **command palettes**, this app lets you log your finances **as fast as you think**.

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

- 🧭 **One line. One entry. One flow.**
- ⌨️ **Keyboard-first**. No tabbing. No mouse.
- 🧠 **Smart parsing**. Natural language style input.
- 📌 **Pin recurring context** like account, date, or tags — enter dozens of entries without repetition.
- 🗂 **Batch entries**. Log multiple transactions in one go.

---

## ✨ Example Usage

### 🔹 A single entry:
```
> ₹150 coffee @Starbucks from HDFC on Apr 10 #food
```

### 🔹 Pin context:
```
> pin from HDFC on Apr 10 #food
```
Now just:
```
> ₹120 sandwich @Subway
> ₹200 tea @Chaayos
```

All inherit the pinned values.

### 🔹 Unpin:
```
> unpin all
```

### 🔹 Batch mode:
Paste multiple lines:
```
> ₹100 dosa @Sagar
> ₹80 juice @JuiceHub
> ₹60 vada @StreetStall
```

Boom — logged instantly.
